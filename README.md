#Grapple

Just a simple game where one, to two (or more, maybe), player(s) battle in a world with ever changing gravity,
powerups (that *may* create unstable blackholes), dangerous platforms, and more! 

##History
***Grapple*** is an updated projected based on a physics project that was used to demonstrate forces.
The project was set in a "Future Labratory" where special fighting ships were used, trying to 
blow the other one up. In this lab, gravity is not constant; without warning, the force of gravity
will change. The ever changing gravity introduces a mechanic in which the players must balance their
ships to keep it in the arena. Mastering this is key to the success. The project also include a variety
of "powerups" that did other physics related things like distort the opponent's mass, increase gravity's pull,
throw them into a black hole... *the usual.*
<br /><br />
The project is now a WIP to becoming a game with both singleplayer, local multiplayer, and possibly 
mulitplayer on a server. Remaining true to its roots, the game utilizes the ever chaning gravity, powerups,
explosions, and black holes, to name a few.

##Current Status
*Note:* Grapple is currently in very early stages of devolopment. <br />

###Controls
W - Apply an upward force to your ship
S - Apply a down force to your ship
A - Apply a leftward force to your ship
D - Apply a rightward force to your ship

###Gravity
Gravity is currently functional; it will also randomly change in direction.
