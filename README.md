# Grapple

An old program (from 2014/2015) used to demonstrate forces for a high-school project. 

## Note
This project was left in a state intended to test collision detection between a player projectile and a test dummy. It isn't in active devolopment. It may be returned to at a later time.

## Description
Two ships fight in an arena to either blow-up or knock out their opponent. To add a layer of difficult, the direction of gravity in the arena changes periodically. Since the original project wasn't saved, this is a revived project. 

## Current State

### Controls
W - Apply an upward force to your ship<br />
S - Apply a down force to your ship<br />
A - Apply a leftward force to your ship<br />
D - Apply a rightward force to your ship<br />

### Gravity
Gravity changes directions periodically.

### Power-ups
There are power-ups the player can catch.
